	<h1>Hi there, I'm Ayoub!</h1>
	<p>I'm an Embedded Systems engineering student at Polytech Sorbonne in Paris, graduating in September 2020.
	I'm italian with moroccan roots and I have been living in France for five years now. I like to define myself as the result
	of mixing several cultures.
	</p>

	<p>I'm very passionated about technology and innovation, especially in the fields of electronics and computer science.
	This is one of the reasons that lead me to choose embedded systems as a major for my studies, since it combines these
	two fields blending hardware and software. During my studies and school projects I have discovered that I really enjoy
	low-level programming: it's funny (sometimes) to enter processors' minds and build architectures from scratch.
	</p>

	<p>During my internships, especially the last one, I had to develop a custom IoT solutions for agriculture application.
	These experiences gave me a deep understanding of this technology, the benefits brought by it and thought me
	the methodology for the design process. IoT systems may appear simpler than others; this is partly true because
	often we don't have real-time costraints, but the architecture still remains complex with layers going from the
	bare-metal to the cloud. You can find more details about my work experience <a href="/resume">here</a>.
	</p>

	<p>In my free time I try to learn new stuff that can be useful to me in the future, take photos and (obviously) watch tv shows.
	I will probably add a section to my portfolio so that I can showcase some of my shoots in the future.
	Recently I have started working on some open-source projects. I find the concpet of a community sharing their code
	very interesting and I'm delighted to contribute when I can.
	</p>

	<p>I <em>love</em> football (or soccer, call it whatever you want). I started to play at very young age and even if
	currently I'm not part of any team I still enjoy a good match from time to time.
	</p>

	<p>Currently I'm studying in Montr√©al, Canada. I had the good fortune of being selected for an exchange program ending in
 	December 2019. Before I graduate, in September 2020, I have to complete a six-month internship. If you are interested
	in my profile don't hesitate to contact me. You now know what the fields that interest me are so you don't need me
	to add anything else :)
