	<h1>Hi there, I'm Ayoub!</h1>
	<p>I'm a Embedded Systems engineering student at Polytech Sorbonne in Paris, graduating in September 2020.
	I'm italian with moroccan roots and I have been living in France for five years now. I like to define myself as the result
	of mixing several cultures.
	</p>

	<p>I'm very passionated about technology and innovation, especially in the fields of electronics and computer science.
	This is one of the reasons that lead me to choose embedded systems as a major for my studies, since it combines these
	two fields blending hardware and software. During my studies and schoold projects I have discovered that I really enjoy
	low-level programming: it's funny (sometimes) to impersonate processors and build architectures from scratch.
	</p>

	<p>During my internships, especially the last one, I had to develop custom IoT solutions for the agriculture.
	These experiences gave me a deep understanding of this technology, the benefits brought by it and thought me
	the methodology for the design process. IoT systems may appear simpler than others; this is partly true because
	often we don't have real-time costraints, but the architecture still remains complex with layers going from the
	bare-metal to the cloud. You can find more details about my work experience here.
	</p>

	<p>In my free time I try to learn new stuff that can be useful to me in the future, take photos and (obviously) watching tv shows.
	Recently I have started working on some open-source projects. I find the concpet of a community sharing their codes
	very interesting and I'm delighted to contribute when I can.
	</p>

	<p>I <em>love</em> football (or soccer, call it whatever you want). I started to play it at very young age and even if
	currently I'm not part of any team I still practice it from time to time.
	</p>

	<p>Currently I'm studying in Montr√©al, Canada. I had the chance to be selected for an exchange program ending in
 	December 2019. Before I graduate in September 2020, I have to perform a six-month internship. If you are interested
	in my profile don't hesitate to contact me.
