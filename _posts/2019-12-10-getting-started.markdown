<!-- ## introduction

This post is the first of a collection in which I will cover some basic aspects of software development on microcontrollers. Everything you need if you want to apply the insights shown in this series is a stm32 board. Personally I will be using a _STM32L452_ from STMicroelectronics which comes with a Cortex-M4 core at 80 MHz, 512 kb of flash memory and 160 kb of SRAM. This microcontroller also integrates various peripherals:

- GPIO
- USART
- I2C
- SPI
- DMA
- ADC/DAC
- timers
- watchdog
- and many others...

In this series of tutorials I will try to explore as much of them as I can. -->

<!-- ## setup the toolchain

I really recommend [this][1] guide. It has written for macOS but it shouldn't be that different for linux users. Follow the steps and at the end you should have installed on your machine:
- GNU ARM toolchain (compiler, debugger and others...)
- STCubeMX (makefile generation, Hardware Abstraction Layer and Low Level drivers)
- STCubeProgrammer (flash the code on your board)
- STLink (allows to launch a gdb server for debugging)

## create a project

- describe how to create a blinky project
- how to compile
- how to flash the code on the board -->
